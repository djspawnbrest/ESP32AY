# ZxPod - multiformat Turbo Sound player
ESP32 based AY Turbo Sound multiformat player

## Fast flash firmware avaliable on [Alex Spawn OTA web page](https://ota.alexspawn.ru)

## Starting with firmware version 3.41 - added support for external DAC's - read [External DAC](PCB/ExternalDAC)

## IMPORTANT:
Firmwares from version 3.4 supports only PCB revision C! But you can soldering upgrade revision A and B to C:

Cut JP1 jumper on revisions A and B first!

### From rev.A to B and C:
You need to cut the input track on the resistor R33(see Pic.2) and solder the wire from the ESP32 (see Pic.1) to the cut contact of the resistor. See the images below.

![Fig. 4](PCB/UpgradeToRevC/fromAtoBC4.JPG)

### From rev. A and B to C:
You need to cut the tracks as shown in Figure 5 (red cut lines), then carefully strip the tracks from the solder mask and solder the wires (green lines) to the ESP32.

### Controls
- Before player turning on - hold left button and turn on player to enter root config (needed for change encoder type). Encoder types:
    1. STEP 4L - active low (pull-up to VCC). Full cycle (4 phases) per click.
    2. STEP 4H - active high (pull-up to GND). Full cycle (4 phases) per click
    3. STEP 2 - half cycle (2 phases) per click (Set by default)
    4. STEP 1 - quarter cycle (1 phase) per click, and non-latching encoders
- Before player turning on - hold right button and turn on player to reset config to default.
- Encoder Hold - change mode player/file browser
- Encoder Click - in player mode - play/pause; in file browser mode select track/playlist/directory; select - in config mode
- Encoder Double click - in player mode - open settings
- Encoder Push and turn right - fast forward (for ay format change next subsong)
- Encoder Push and turn left - slow down (for ay format change previous subsong)
- Left button click/hold - volume - (in player mode); cancel - in config mode
- Right button click/hold - volume + (in player mode)
- Left button double click - change AY clock (in player mode) for PSG formats or change stereo panning for formats over DAC (mod,s3m etc.)
